## ‚ö° Setup

### 1. Get Telegram API credentials
1. Go to [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).  
2. Log in with your Telegram number.  
3. Create a new app ‚Üí copy your **API ID** and **API Hash**.

---

### 2. Generate Session File
You need a Telegram session file (`mention_bot.session`) before deployment.

Create a file called `generate_session.py` with this code:


```python
from telethon import TelegramClient
from telethon.sessions import StringSession

api_id = int(input("Enter your API_ID: "))
api_hash = input("Enter your API_HASH: ")
session_name = input("Enter your session name: ")

client = TelegramClient(StringSession(), api_id, api_hash)

async def main():
    await client.start()

    # Save session string to file as text
    with open(f"{session_name}.session", "w") as f:
        f.write(client.session.save())

    print(f"‚úÖ Session file generated: {session_name}.session")
    print(f"üí° Session string:\n{client.session.save()}")

with client:
    client.loop.run_until_complete(main())
```


üìù When you run this script, you will be asked to:

‚¶Å API_ID ‚Üí The numeric ID from my.telegram.org.

‚¶Å API_HASH ‚Üí The secret hash from the same place.

‚¶Å Session name ‚Üí Any name you like (e.g., mention_bot).


‚ö° During the first login, you will also provide:

‚¶Å Phone number ‚Üí Your Telegram account number.

‚¶Å OTP ‚Üí One-time password sent via SMS or Telegram app.

‚¶Å 2FA password ‚Üí If two-factor authentication is enabled.


‚úÖ After successful login, this script generates a session string, which is a critical piece for headless deployments:

You must store this session string in your .env file (as SESSION_STRING) or as an environment variable.

Using the session string allows the bot to run without re-entering your phone number, OTP, or 2FA.

Keep the session string private ‚Äî anyone with it can access your Telegram account.


‚ö° Important: To run this bot, you must provide your own API ID, API Hash, and SESSION_STRING. Once stored, the bot can start automatically without further manual login.

## 3. Environment Setup

Before running the userbot, you need to set up a few environment variables.  
These should be set in your hosting platform‚Äôs environment settings.

### Required Variables

| Variable          | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `API_ID`          | Your Telegram **API ID** from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).   |
| `API_HASH`        | Your Telegram **API Hash** from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org). |
| `SESSION_STRING`  | The session string generated by running the session script locally. This allows the bot to log in without entering your phone number and OTP every time. |
| `ALLOWED_USERS`   | (Optional) Comma-separated Telegram user IDs allowed to use the bot. If not provided, only the API owner can use the userbot. |

### Example `.env`

```env
API_ID=123456
API_HASH=abcd1234efgh5678
SESSION_STRING=your_generated_session_string_here
ALLOWED_USERS=123456789,987654321
