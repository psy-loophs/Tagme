Includes owner-only and allowed-users access control, and stop/start tagging support.  

---

## ‚ú® Usage
- `/tagall` ‚Üí Mentions all group members.  
- Prevents multiple tagging sessions at once.  
- `!stop` ‚Üí Stops tagging process.

  ## Features

- First name mentions: 
  - Instead of showing full usernames, the bot tag members using their first names only, making the chat cleaner.

- Custom messages:
  - Use !tagall &lt;message&gt; to mention all members along with your custom message.

Works whether you reply to a message or not.


- Reply tagging:
  - If you reply to any message with !tagall, the bot will tag all members in reply to that message.

## ‚ö° Setup

### 1. Get Telegram API credentials
1. Go to [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).  
2. Log in with your Telegram number.  
3. Create a new app ‚Üí copy your **API ID** and **API Hash**.

### 2. Generate Session File
You need a Telegram session file (`mention_bot.session`) before deployment.

Create a file called `generate_session.py` with this code:


```python
from telethon import TelegramClient
from telethon.sessions import StringSession

api_id = int(input("Enter your API_ID: "))
api_hash = input("Enter your API_HASH: ")
session_name = input("Enter your session name: ")

client = TelegramClient(StringSession(), api_id, api_hash)

async def main():
    await client.start()

    # Save session string to file as text
    with open(f"{session_name}.session", "w") as f:
        f.write(client.session.save())

    print(f"‚úÖ Session file generated: {session_name}.session")
    print(f"üí° Session string:\n{client.session.save()}")

with client:
    client.loop.run_until_complete(main())
```


üìù When you run this script, you will be asked to:

‚¶Å API_ID ‚Üí The numeric ID from my.telegram.org.

‚¶Å API_HASH ‚Üí The secret hash from the same place.

‚¶Å Session name ‚Üí Any name you like (e.g., mention_bot).


‚ö° During the first login, you will also provide:

‚¶Å Phone number ‚Üí Your Telegram account number.

‚¶Å OTP ‚Üí One-time password sent via SMS or Telegram app.

‚¶Å 2FA password ‚Üí If two-factor authentication is enabled.


‚úÖ After successful login, this script generates a session string, which is a critical piece for headless deployments:

You must store this session string in your .env file (as SESSION_STRING) or as an environment variable.

Using the session string allows the bot to run without re-entering your phone number, OTP, or 2FA.

Keep the session string private ‚Äî anyone with it can access your Telegram account.


‚ö° Important: To run this bot, you must provide your own API ID, API Hash, and SESSION_STRING. Once stored, the bot can start automatically without further manual login.
